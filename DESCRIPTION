Description: Generate mutations in a set of genes according to a given mutational process,
    total number of silent mutations per gene, total numbers of silent mutations per sample
    and total number of non-silent mutations per sample. Allows to observe the distribution 
    of non-silent mutations in the genes of interest and estimate the probability of damaging
    mutations occuring by chance.
