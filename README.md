# MutSim
R package for generating substitutions in genes caused by a certain mutation process and according to total mutation numbers in a set of samples.
May be useful for testing if mutation rate in a particular gene is a consequence of the overall mutation burden or not.

## Installation

```
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('nvolkova/MutSim')
```
Usage examples are described in the vignette.
